Your `TextDataset` class is not deterministic in that the `word2idx` and `idx2word` mappings are not necessarily in the same order when the class is instantiated multiple times. This is a problem as your trained CNN will expect the words in the order seen in this notebook, but the autograder will be using a different ordering. If this is your issue, reimplement the `TextDataset` class so that it is deterministic, and then retrain and upload your model.</font>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vTiiYDZIF--7"},"outputs":[],"source":["### DO NOT EDIT ###\n","\n","import random\n","\n","def evaluate(model, data_loader, criterion, use_tqdm=False):\n","    print('Evaluating performance on the test dataset...')\n","    has_printed=False\n","    model.eval()\n","    epoch_loss = 0\n","    epoch_acc = 0\n","    all_predictions = []\n","    iterator = tqdm(data_loader) if use_tqdm else data_loader\n","    total = 0\n","    for texts, labels in iterator:\n","        bs = texts.shape[0]\n","        total += bs\n","        texts = texts.to(DEVICE)\n","        labels = labels.to(DEVICE)\n","\n","        output = model(texts)\n","        acc = accuracy(output, labels) * len(labels)\n","        pred = output.argmax(dim=1)\n","        all_predictions.append(pred)\n","\n","        loss = criterion(output, labels) * len(labels)\n","\n","        epoch_loss += loss.item()\n","        epoch_acc += acc.item()\n","\n","        if random.random() < 0.0015 and bs == 1:\n","            if not has_printed: print(\"\\nSOME PREDICTIONS FROM THE MODEL:\")\n","            print(\"Input: \"+' '.join([data_loader.dataset.idx2word[idx] for idx in texts[0].tolist() if idx not in {data_loader.dataset.word2idx[CNN_PAD], data_loader.dataset.word2idx[CNN_END]}]))\n","            print(\"Prediction:\", pred.item(), '\\tCorrect Output:', labels.item(), '\\n')\n","            has_printed=True\n","\n","    full_acc = 100*epoch_acc/total\n","    full_loss = epoch_loss/total\n","    print('[TEST]\\t Loss: {:.4f}\\t Accuracy: {:.2f}%'.format(full_loss, full_acc))\n","    predictions = torch.cat(all_predictions)\n","    return predictions, full_acc, full_loss"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Z718w8e0oNoS"},"outputs":[],"source":["### DO NOT EDIT ###\n","\n","if __name__=='__main__':\n","    evaluate(cnn_model, test_loader, criterion, use_tqdm=True) # Compute test data accuracy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8WQAV6O2xHvS"},"source":["# What to Submit\n","\n","To submit the assignment, download this notebook as a <TT>.py</TT> file.
